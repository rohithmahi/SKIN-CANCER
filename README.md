**Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning**

This project aims to automate the detection of skin cancer using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on the InceptionV3 architecture. It enhances diagnostic accuracy by analyzing images of skin lesions and classifying them as cancerous or non-cancerous.
Project Overview

Skin cancer is a common and potentially deadly disease. Early detection significantly improves treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This project proposes an automated solution using deep learning to analyze skin images, helping in the early detection of skin cancer.
Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model for automated skin cancer detection, aiming to:

    Improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosis.
    Assist dermatologists in identifying cancerous lesions.
    Enhance early detection for better patient outcomes.

Existing System

The traditional approach involves using Support Vector Machine (SVM) models with manually extracted features. However, this approach has limitations:

    Manual feature extraction can be complex.
    Scalability and interpretability are challenging.
    Limited accuracy for large datasets.

Proposed System

The proposed system uses CNNs with the InceptionV3 architecture:

    Automatic Feature Extraction: The CNN automatically learns features from images.
    InceptionV3 Architecture: Multiple convolutional operations are used to capture features at different scales.
    Classification: The model classifies images based on the extracted features.

Advantages

    Automatic feature extraction
    Enhanced accuracy
    Better scalability
    Improved interpretability
